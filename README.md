### **Hello there, I'm Wilson Martinez ðŸ‘‹**

## About Me
I am passionate about programming, especially with Python, although I also have experience with other languages. Thanks to my background as an electronic engineer, I can program anything from complete applications to microchips, combining hardware and software to create innovative solutions.

I enjoy continuous learning and working on projects that present a challenge.

In addition to my technical skills, I love literature, music, and great movies.

In my profile, you will find projects with an innovative and functional approach. I hope you find something interesting and useful here!

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
